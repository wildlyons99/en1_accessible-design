  <h1>Web-Based SPIKE Prime Control Documentation</h1>

  <p>This documentation describes how to setup and create interactive web-based interfaces
    for controlling the SPIKE Prime.</p>

  <p>It was originally created by Ethan Danahy in November and December 2020
    for use by his first-year engineering course at Tufts University.

  <h2>Setting up Airtable</h2>

  <blockquote>

    <p>See Canvas for instructions on creating an Airtable account.</p>

    <p>To access your Airtable data remotely, you need three things:
      <ul>
        <li>Your Airtable API Key (found under your <a href="https://airtable.com/account" target=_blank>Airtable Account</a> settings); it should look like "keyXXXXXXXXXXXXX"</li>
        <li>Your Base ID (found under your <a href="https://airtable.com/api" target=_blank>REST API</a> settings); it should look like "appYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"</li>
        <li>The name of your table (e.g. "myProject" or "demo01" etc)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>The Airtable API and the Base ID need to be entered into the <b>"/src/secret.js"</b> file.
      Here is the location of that file in the folder structure:</p>

    <img src="./img/secret_file_location.png">

    <p>Inside that file, you should be updating lines #19 (Airtable API Key) and #20 (Airtable Base ID):</p>

    <img src="./img/Cloud_API.png">

    <p>Notes:
      <ul>
        <li>You can see that the API key variable is "split" with <em>"key"</em> separated from the random string you've been assigned</li>
        <li>You can see that the Base ID variable is "split" with <em>"app"</em> separated from the random string you've been assigned</li>
        <li>Ignore the "SystemLink" portion of the page; we are using Airtable and not SystemLink for this project.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Then for each page you create (remote, local, etc) that you want to
      access a data table within Airtable, you need to specify your Table Name.
      Make sure you enter it into any/every page where you are connecting to Airtable.
    </p>

    <p>Here is an example from <b><em>myProject_remote.html</em></b> showing that
      the Airtable tablename of "myProject" has been entered into the ServiceDock on line 13.

  <h2>Creating Remote File</h2>

  <blockquote>

    <p>The header of the <b>Remote</b> page needs to include the following:
      <ul>
        <li>The ServiceDock code, hosted externally at cdn.jsdelivr.net.</li>
        <li>A reference to "secret.js" that has your Airtable API Key and Base ID information.</li>
        <li>Including all the code from "cloud.js" that renders the page and does all the cloud communication.</li>
        <li>Import in "style.css" that has some style sheet information.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <img src="./img/myProject_remote_head.png">

    <p>In addition to these essential files, you can add to this head your own:
      <ul>
        <li>Style information for formatting the document.  This can use the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag.</li>
        <li>Custom JavaScript functions for creating an interactive interfaces. These can use a new <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.<li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>In the body of the document you need to include the Service Dock that performs the connection to Airtable.
      Make sure you update the <em>tablename</em> to reference the table you want to use in your project.</p>

  <h2>Creating Local File</h2>

  <blockquote>

    <p>The header of the <b>Local</b> page needs to include the following:
      <ul>
        <li>The ServiceDock code, hosted externally at cdn.jsdelivr.net.</li>
        <li>A reference to "secret.js" that has your Airtable API Key and Base ID information.</li>
        <li>Including all the code from "cloud.js" that renders the page and does all the cloud communication.</li>
        <li>Import in "style.css" that has some style sheet information.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <img src="./img/myProject_local_head.png">

    <p>In addition to these essential files, you can add to this head your own:
      <ul>
        <li>Style information for formatting the document.  This can use the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag.</li>
        <li>Custom JavaScript functions for creating an interactive interfaces. These can use a new <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.<li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>In the body of the document you need to include the Service Dock that
      performs both the connection to Airtable as well as connecting to the SPIKE Prime.
      <ul>
        <li>For Airtable: make sure you update the <em>tablename</em> to reference
          the table you want to use in your project.</li>
        <li>For SPIKE Prime: make sure you are using a Chrome Browser and
          activate the SPIKE Prime prior to your code running.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p><b><em>Reminder about SPIKE Prime:</em></b></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>To use the SPIKEâ„¢ Prime hardware,</b> you must be using a recent version of the <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome browser</a>.</p>
