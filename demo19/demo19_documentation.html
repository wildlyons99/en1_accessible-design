	<h1>Demo 19: Two Player Rock-Paper-Scissors Project</h1>

  <p>This project-demo shows two-way communication as well as using two
    SPIKE Primes that are remotely located from each other.</p>

  <h2>Documentation</h2>

	<p>Be sure to view the <a href="../documentation/index.html">overall Documentation</a> for configuring
		the cloud storage (API key, Base ID, etc) and for more information on how the entire system works.</p>

	<h3>Project Design</h3>

	<blockquote>

		<p>Here is an overview of how the project is structured/flows.</p>

	<h3>Airtable Setup</h3>

	<blockquote>

		<p>The Airtable is set up as follows:
			<ul>
				<li><em>p1_throw</em>: holds Player 1 status information</li>
				<li><em>p2_throw</em>: holds Player 2 status information</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

	<h3>Player 1 Page Setup</h3>

	<blockquote>

		<p><b>Service Dock</b></p>

		<p>The remote page has the Airtable Service Dock element. Make sure to
			update the <em>tablename</em> attribute to match your table name.</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo19_servicedock.png">

		<p><b>Interface</b></p>

		<p></p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo19_code.png">

		<p>This is what the interface will look like for Player 1 (after the game has been played):</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo19_interface.png">

		<p>Note that, also within the HTML code, is the Cloud Monitoring elements.
			These are all hidden from view, but are still in the page, activated, and
			monitoring the Cloud for changes.</p>

		<p>For debugging, to see these rendered in the page, change the
			<code>style="display: none"</code> to be <code>style="display: inline"</code></p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo19_monitor.png">

		<p>Here are all the <b>JavaScript Functions</b> that help the page run:</p>

		<p><code>onload_pre()</code>: this function runs when the page loads,
			and is designed to "reset" everything (page elements, style, etc)</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo19_javascript_onloadpre.png">

		<p>Note: the styles used by the page are as follows. Beyond formatting, this
			also has <em>highlight</em> (color the table element gray) and <em>select</em>
			(color the table element green) for the user selecting their throw choice.</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo19_style.png">

		<p><code>onload_post()</code>: this function runs after the Cloud Service
			has been configured and started. It monitors (to make sure the Cloud Service
			is Active) and then clears out the <code>p1_throw</code> and
			<code>p2_throw</code> values in the Cloud.</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo19_javascript_onloadpost.png">

		<p>When the Play Game button is pushed, the <code>p1_throw</code> value is
			updated, and the monitor will trigger the <code>start_game()</code> function.
			This function reveals the throw-selector table, and then starts monitoring
			the motor (see next function).
		</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo19_javascript_startgame.png">

		<p>The <code>monitor_motor()</code> function constantly checks the SPIKE Prime's
			motor position (<code>mySPIKE.Motor('A').get_position()</code>) and based
			on the position determines what type of throw the user wants. (The motor
			position is passed to <code>eval_motor_position</code> that passes back
			a string of "rock", "paper", or "scissors".)</p>

		<p>The Force Sensor is monitored (<code>mySPIKE.ForceSensor('B').is_pressed()</code>)
			and when pressed, the Cloud Name <code>p1_throw</code> is set to whatever
			the current choice is ("rock", "paper", or "scissors").</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo19_javascript_monitormotor.png">

		<p>When the <code>p1_throw</code> value changes to "rock", "paper", or "scissors"
			(as monitored by the Cloud Monitoring elements in the HTML), the
			<code>game_throw()</code> function is triggered. The main functionality of this
			is to then "wait for Player 2 to make their choice." This is achieved by
			constantly calling the <code>monitor_throw()</code> function that checks
			the <code>p2_throw</code> value to see if the opponent has thrown yet.</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo19_javascript_gamethrow.png">

		<p>When both <code>p1_throw</code> and <code>p2_throw</code> have been thrown,
			it is time to <code>show_result()</code>: even though the result is already
			known, this function does a countdown ("3" ... "3" ... "1" ... on the
			SPIKE Prime LED Matrix) routine and then (1) displays what Player 1 threw
			on the SPIKE Prime LED Matrix and (2) shows the overall result (Win, Lose, Tie)
			in the webpage.</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo19_javascript_showresult.png">

	<h3>Player 2 Page Setup</h3>

	<blockquote>

		<p>The <b>Player 2 Page</b> setup is identical to the Player 1 page, but
			switches the references from "Player 1" (and <code>p1_throw</code>) to
			"Player 2" (and <code>p2_throw</code>).</p>

		<p>Here are all the differences between demo19_player1.html and demo19_player2.html</p>

		<p>Title of the page:</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo19_player2_title.png">

		<p>Updating the Cloud value when Force Sensor is pressed:</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo19_player2_force.png">

		<p>A debugging statement (when the throw happens):</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo19_player2_gamethrow.png">

		<p>Getting the right value of the opponents throw (in monitor throw):</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo19_player2_monitorthrow.png">

		<p>In show result, getting the right throw:</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo19_player2_showresult.png">

		<p>Within the HTML of the page, making sure the right player info is shown
			and the Play Game button updates the proper field.</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo19_player2_html.png">

		<p>All the Monitor Cloud values monitor the Player 2 (<code>p2_throw</code>)
			value instead:</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo19_player2_monitor.png">
