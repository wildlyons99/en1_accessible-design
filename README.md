# Intro to Engineering: Simple Robotics Final Project

Tom Lyons, Noah Stiegler, Bode Wildgrube, and Aiden Auretto worked together to develop and create an interactive robotic playful experience for students from the 
Horace Mann School for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing. A focus of this project was to create an accessable webpage and design for deaf students for whom English was a second language.

For our project, we wanted to create a remote shuffleboard game. Tom Lyons and Noah Stiegler worked together on the code for this project, while Bode Wildgrube and Aiden Auretto designed and built the board and launchers. 

## Features:

Two remote player websites and two local back end websites which connect via database.

Embedded variable MicroPython for LEGO code which controls our shuffle board robot.

Image processing website which uses OpenCV.js to detect shuffle board pucks and automatically assigns point values to database for display to users.
