	<h1>Demo 16: LED Toggle Project</h1>

  <p>This project-demo shows how to create an interface that toggles the LEDs.</p>

  <h2>Documentation</h2>

	<p>Be sure to view the <a href="../documentation/index.html">overall Documentation</a> for configuring
		the cloud storage (API key, Base ID, etc) and for more information on how the entire system works.</p>

	<h3>Airtable Setup</h3>

	<blockquote>

		<p>The Airtable is set up with 25 records, each one for an individual pixel
			in the 5x5 light matrix array. Each is initialized to zero: but will toggle
			between "0" and "100".
		</p>

	<h3>Remote Page Setup</h3>

	<blockquote>

		<p><b>Service Dock</b></p>

		<p>The remote page has the Airtable Service Dock element. Make sure to
			update the <em>tablename</em> attribute to match your table name.</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo16_remote_servicedock.png">

		<p><b>Remote Interface</b></p>

		<p>The interface has two parts:
			<ol>
				<li>The left is a series of buttons that toggle through values (0, 100)
					and store them in the cloud</li>
				<li>The right is a space to "load" in images to try and match. (This
					just happens in the browser; it doesn't use the Cloud or SPIKE Prime at all.)</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<p>Here is the table for generating the array of buttons. Note there is a
			button at the top of the table (right side) for randomly generating the
			match image.</p>

		<p>Each "toggle button" updates that position (LED + row + col) in the Cloud
			to be "0" (off) or "100" (on).</p>

		<p>Here is the table for generating the matching image:</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo16_remote_code2.png">

		<p>This is what the interface will look like on the Remote Page. There
			are a collection of CSS Style attributes in the head of the document that
			are used for formatting the tables.</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo16_remote_interface.png">

		<p>This is the JavaScript that (1) has the images for matching and (2)
			randomly picks one and displays it in the "match" table on the right.</p>

	<h3>Local Page Setup</h3>

	<blockquote>

		<p><b>Service Dock</b></p>

		<p>The local page has both the Airtable Service Dock element (make sure
			to update the <em>tablename</em> attribute to match your table name).
			There is also a single SPIKE Prime Service Dock element.</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo16_local_servicedock.png">

		<p><b>Local Interface</b></p>

		<p>The local page is monitoring all the different entries in the Cloud. This is just
			the same code over and over, each entry calling the <code>toggle_pixel</code> function.
		</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo16_local_code.png">

		<p>This is how the interface will look on the Local Page:</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo16_local_interface.png">

		<p>This is the JavaScript code for updating the SPIKE Prime's pixel when
			the Cloud changes. We take in the name of the field (e.g. "LED34") and
			parse out the row and column (3, 4) and then set the pixel to equal the
			value ("0" or "100") in the Cloud.</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo16_local_javascript1.png">

		<p>Note that we want to initialize the SPIKE Prime's light matrix to equal
			whatever settings are in the Cloud when it first connects.  To do this we
			are using several callback functions:
			<ul>
				<li><code>onload_post</code>: this function is called when the page loads
					but <em>after</em> the Service Dock has been set up.</li>
				<li><code>mySPIKE.executeAfterInit()</code>: this is set wtihin onload_post
					to be called after the SPIKE Prime is initialized.  When it is (e.g. when
					the user has connected the SPIKE Prime) we then want to go through
					and update the display.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>The extra "sleep" has been added because if a sequence of JSON commands are
			issued to the SPIKE Prime too quickly then it'll miss some.</p>
