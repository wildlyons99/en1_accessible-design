	<h1>Demo 08: Form Input</h1>

  <p>This demo shows how to use a form input which allows updates prior to pressing button.</p>

  <h2>Documentation</h2>

	<p>Be sure to view the <a href="../documentation/index.html">overall Documentation</a> for configuring
		the cloud storage (API key, Base ID, etc) and for more information on how the entire system works.</p>

	<h3>Airtable Setup</h3>

	<blockquote>

		<p>The "Name" column has an entry "motor_speed" that will hold the updated values
			from the Range Slider and "command" that gets a command from the Form's Submit Button.
			The "Value" of motor_speed will be a number used to control the motor and the
			command will be "Run" when it is time to run the code.
		</p>

	<h3>Remote Page Setup</h3>

	<blockquote>

		<p><b>Service Dock</b></p>

		<p>The remote page has the Airtable Service Dock element. Make sure to
			update the <em>tablename</em> attribute to match your table name.</p>

		<p><b>Remote Interface</b></p>

		<p>The slider will change the cloud value every time it changes.  But nothing
			will happen with the robot until the "Run" command is sent to the cloud.
		</p>

		<p>See the Range Slider demo for more information about the slider functionality.</p>

		<p>This is how the range slider and form will look on the Remote Page:</p>

	<h3>Local Page Setup</h3>

	<blockquote>

		<p><b>Service Dock</b></p>

		<p>The local page has both the Airtable Service Dock element (make sure
			to update the <em>tablename</em> attribute to match your table name).
			There is also a single SPIKE Prime Service Dock element.</p>

		<img class="documentation_image" src="./img/demo08_local_servicedock.png">

		<p><b>Local Interface</b></p>

		<p>The local page isn't monitoring the motor_speed value. So nothing happens
			when that changes (when the user moves the Range Slider).</p>

		<p>When the "command" value equals "Run" (e.g. when the user submits the form),
			then the code is downloaded and run on the SPIKE Prime.  Note that there is a
			replace that happens in the code, this time with "CLOUD[motor_speed]" that
			looks up the current value of "motor_speed" in the cloud.
		</p>

		<p>After the code is run, the cloud "command" is reset to nothing.  This allows
			the user to re-submit the form and send "Run" once again.
		</p>

		<p>This is how the element will look on the Local Page:</p>
